## Blazor United Sample

This solution used .NET 8 Preview 6 bits to show what models are available within Blazor. So far there are 4 to choose from:

- Server-side rendered pages (default)
- Server-side streaming pages (HTML will be sent as it's processed in real-time)
- Blazor Server-side WebSockets
- Blazor Wasm

These four approaches give developers options when building Blazor-based applications.
